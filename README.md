# Welcome to My Site's Repo!

## Project History

This is my first personal website and blog, which I built after securing the domain rohannelson.com.
It is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), and deployed via [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

Initially I built out the structure and early content of the website with less attention to design/branding, [you can currently view an earlier build here](https://c5f95bf7.rohannelson.pages.dev/).

After a while, I integrated my site with [Strapi](https://strapi.io/), and deployed Strapi as a webservice through [Render](https://render.com).
After using this configuration for a little while, I decided to roll back to vanilla Astro.

Then I asked my wife, who is a graphic designer, to mock up a redesign of my website for me. After a few revisions, we arrived at the current design, which I then implemented.

At some point I also added a page with some [board games that I have been making with React](https://rohannelson.com/projects/). I have been making them partly to learn React, and partly for fun.
