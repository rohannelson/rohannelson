* I wonder about having some sort of date to give an indication of when things where happening (particularly with reference to My Story posts)
* I'd like for tags (and publication date) to be visible somehow, and to be able to access archive pages by tag.
* I'd like to have buttons to move between the next and previous posts. It could also be possible to include a link to other posts with the same tag?
