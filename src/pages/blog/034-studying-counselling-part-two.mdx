Today I had a potentially significant experience, and I also got to explore it a bit as part of&nbsp;class.

During a process-oriented activity I somehow thought of my interest in the interplay between theology and psychology, and I had a noticeably strong sense to say something about this. As I spoke, I included the idea that some of the things that we teach in church could be damaging. I think two people in the group found me acknowledging this (as a pastor) to be quite impactful, and they said as much. In turn, I found their responses to be quite impactful and I felt a bit shaky in my chest&nbsp;afterwards.

Later in the day I took the opportunity to process this experience as a practice client (we took turns being 'clients' for other students who were practicing counselling). I’m not sure that I landed anywhere in particular, except that perhaps this is another piece in the puzzle of where God is leading&nbsp;me... Someone did ask an interesting question, though. I was asked if there could be some link between my [call to teaching](/blog/007-calling-to-ministry) and my [potential gift of healing](/blog/028-a-significant-experience-and-gift). I hadn’t considered the possibility of healing in a more metaphorical way before... In some ways it would be a bit of a cop-out, but then again perhaps it could be seen as spiritual rather than physical&nbsp;healing?

Curiously, this relates to recent tensions I’ve been feeling about who will look after those who have been damaged by or disenfranchised by mainstream church. I wonder what it would look like to reach out to and minister to these&nbsp;people?
