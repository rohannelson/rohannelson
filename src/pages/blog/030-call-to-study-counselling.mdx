I was at a professional development morning called Pastoral Triage, and at the end, the trainer mentioned that Morling College would be starting some Counselling, Chaplaincy, and Spiritual Care courses at the Perth campus next year. When she was talking about this, I had quite a strong sense that I should be doing that course. (My recollection at the time of posting this is that this sense came with the words 'next&nbsp;year.')

I had previously been thinking about studying something along these lines. Psychology seemed like too drawn-out a course pathway, but I wanted to do some serious study instead of just a certificate in chaplaincy or something. Because of this I was considering the possibility of studying&nbsp;counselling.

When I had this sense that I should be studying counselling at Morling, my immediate internal response was that Morling would be too expensive, so I’d probably have to checkout the public universities. Funnily enough, after checking it out today (Sep 26, 2022), studying a Master of Counselling at Morling actually seems like a pretty reasonable option to pursue. That said, I’m not sure whether or not I would take the leap without this prod from&nbsp;God.

It will be interesting to see how this pans&nbsp;out!

In an interesting development, Toddler Jam isn’t going ahead this year (I’ve been singing and playing guitar for Toddler Jam on Tuesday mornings). This will be a small hit to our income, and could have been somewhat disorienting in terms of what to do with my time, but because I’ve applied for Counselling at Morling it seems fairly straight forward - I’ll be picking up an extra unit. Very thankful for how this has worked&nbsp;out.
