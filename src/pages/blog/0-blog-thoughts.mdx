* I wonder about having some sort of date to give an indication of when things where happening (particularly with reference to My Story posts)
* I'd like for tags (and publication date) to be visible somehow, and to be able to access archive pages by tag.
* I wonder if I should create a few where the posts merge from one into the next, or whether just having buttons to go to the next one would be better? (I think I prefer the latter)
