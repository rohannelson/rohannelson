I attended biblical Greek classes at the York St Silo from early 2012 until mid 2013. During 2012 we worked through a first year textbook, and then in 2013 we worked our way through 1 John. Even though the classes felt like a hard slog sometimes, I really enjoyed the experience.

Interestingly, while I do think that learning Greek gave me tools to get a clearer sense of what the scriptures say, that’s not what I think of when I reflect on my engagement with scripture at the time. The thing that has actually stuck with me was the experience of reading scripture in community.

But what was it about reading in community that stood out to me? How was this different to, say, a weeknight Bible study?

As I recall, there were a number of us who were learning Greek, and between us we represented quite a variety of theological contexts. Because of this, when we came together to read, we couldn’t always take our own assumptions for granted. One person would read the text one way, and another would read it a different way. This diversity meant that we had to work harder to understand where each other was coming from, and we had to work harder to understand the nuances of what was being said in the text.

Yes, we had our teacher to guide us, but I don’t recall him using his position to override different perspectives. Yes, the skillset he taught us helped us to get closer to what each passage was saying, but there can also be a fair bit of distance between what someone _says_ and what they _mean._ So, at least in my experience, it was the process of people with diverse viewpoints striving together to come to a shared understanding of scripture that made this time so rich.

I’ve been thinking lately about different ways of approaching scripture, and I’m wondering if this experience has something to teach me… Perhaps it would be worth looking for people with different takes on scripture and seeing if they’d join me and some others to read?
