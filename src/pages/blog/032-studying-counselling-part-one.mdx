In my first semester of counselling studies I did two units, one of which was about basic counselling skills but also self-awareness (we had to get 10 sessions of counselling and keep a journal during the semester, etc.). The unit was structured around two three-day intensives which were skills-based, but also heavily process-oriented — for example, there was a lot of time spent debriefing after each exercise, with everyone having an opportunity to share, (sometimes at length).

During a devotional on one of these intensives, I had an experience which I journaled about:

> …during the ‘devotion’ that Jeanette led, when she said ‘touch’, I had this imagery of something deep inside of me getting tapped gently (once, at that moment) and a pulse of some sort of soft golden radiance, and maybe something like that golden pulse radiating out from cracks in what was touched. It felt a bit like something inside of me which may have been dormant was woken up and will be slowly emerging, or growing, or _opening up_. Maybe a part of my emotional attunement or expression? We’ll see…
