When I was quite young, I used to have a lot of nightmares. I don’t remember exactly how it eventuated, but one day I decided to pray about it. From then on, I didn’t have anywhere near as many bad dreams. This must have had a pretty significant impact on me, because after that I prayed “Please may I not have any bad dreams” every single night. I don’t remember when it changed, but I’d say this was part of my stock-standard prayer for about ten years of my childhood:

> _“Dear heavenly Father, please forgive me for my sins, and please may I not have any bad dreams. Amen.”_
