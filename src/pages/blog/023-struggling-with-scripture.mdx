This year (2020) I’ve been struggling with certain topics when engaging with scripture, e.g. passover and communion. I feel like my childhood conception of scripture is really being challenged.

I feel that, in this context, John 5:39(-40?) is for me.
"You search the scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, (yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life.)"
I think the challenge is to seek God Himself - not just [‘truth.’](https://rohannelson.com/blog/006-at-the-cong)
