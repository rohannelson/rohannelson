Today I was trying to turn a [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) button into a headless button (in this case, a button that had functionality, but no styling).

I knew that Shadcn is based on [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/), and that Radix components have the `asChild` atrribute. I gave asChild a shot, but unfortunately it didn't quite do what I thought it would... While it did pass its functionality down to the child component, it also passed down its styling, so no luck there.

After a short break, I remembered some nifty CSS that I had learned during a recent project. I had been trying to create a CSS only tabs component using the `details` and `summary` elements, and came across [a tutorial](https://codepen.io/RYJASM/pen/eYoYeRg) that used `display: contents` and `order` to make the summary elements appear before content divs which were nested in the details components. Here's the HTML:

```
<div class="flex">
<details>
    <summary>
        tab 1 trigger
    </summary>
    <div class="content">
        tab 1 content
    </div>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
        tab 2 trigger
    </summary>
    <div class="content">
        tab 2 content
    </div>
</details>
```

And here's the CSS:

```
div.flex {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
}
details {
    display: contents;
}
summary {
    order: 0;
}
div.content {
    order: 1;
    width: 100%;
}
```

While I'd come across `order` before, `display: contents` was new to me. Not only does it remove the styling from an element, but it also means that its box isn't rendered. It worked for my tabs component (although I needed to add a little JS for Firefox...), and as it turns out, it was also exactly what I needed to turn my Shadcn button into a headless button! It also occurred to me on the way home that I could setup a `headless` prop that could be used for switching the headless functionality on and off. Here's a barebones&nbsp;example:

```
export function MyButton({headless, children}: {headless: boolean, children: ReactNode}) {
    const isHeadless = headless ? "contents" : ""
    return (
        <Button className={isHeadless}>
            {children}
        </Button>
    )
}
```
