Recently I've been building a board games app with [Astro](https://astro.build/), [React](https://react.dev/), and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as a learning project.

During the process, I've had two React components that were previously working fail to hydrate (they were rendered as static HTML with no client-side JavaScript, and therefore no React). Unfortunately, I didn't notice the exact change that caused this regression, so instead of a quick fix, I got to work on my debugging skills...

At some point I noticed that the Supabase client was throwing an error on the client side. Perhaps this could be blocking React from loading? I tried to confine Supabase to the serverside but it was still showing up, and I couldn't figure out why...

Eventually I tried to strip one of the components right back until it started working again &ndash; first removing some child components, and then removing some import statements associated with said child components. To my surprise, removing a few imports fixed it. I went through them one by one and lo and behold it was my `capitalise` helper function that was the culprit...

But why!?

As it turned out, `utils.js` included an import of the Supabase client for another function. I moved the function that required said import, and viola, all was as it should be. So (a) I was right, it was the Supabase client that was causing the problem, and (b) I learned something new &ndash; apparently in Astro if you import a function from a JavaScript file all that file's imports get to come along for the ride...

The moral of the story is be careful how you group your helper functions in Astro, particularly if they require any imports. I know _I'm_ going to have to rethink storing everything together in `utils.js`.
