Today at my request, Melissa reworked my CV and cover letter templates so they tied in with my website (thanks Melissa ðŸ™‚). Because they were already Word documents, she reworked them in Word (rather than Adobe inDesign which would have been her preference).

Afterwards I was tweaking the cover letter template and I discovered something that I didn't know before&mdash;apparently in Word, every 'shape' is a text box. You just have to click the shape and start&nbsp;typing...

Is this trick going to make me a better web developer? No...
But maybe it will prove useful for someone else who has to work with Word against their better judgement one&nbsp;day?

If you're curious, here's a taster from the finished products. I added the logo in the top left of the cover letter for balance:
