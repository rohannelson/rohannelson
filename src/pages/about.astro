  <p>Here's some random things about me!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>I graduated from a Bachelor of Music (Jazz Performance) in 2011.</strong> My
      first love is electric bass, but I can also play double bass, piano, and guitar (to varying
      degrees of competency).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong
        >I'm a Christian, and I feel called to a teaching ministry within the church.</strong
      > I've never been 100% sure what following this calling looks like in practice, but so
      far I've engaged in volunteer ministry and held two paid pastoral roles where I've been
      working with youth or children (amongst other things).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>I graduated from a Master of Divinity in 2018.</strong> I've also had one journal
      article published so far, and would be keen to do a PhD when the time is right!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>I love languages!</strong> I've really enjoyed learning biblical Greek and Hebrew,
      and have tried to keep my knowledge of these languages alive. I've also completed half
      a Latin text-book, dabbled in German, and have now started on programming languages.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>I've recently completed a Graduate Certificate in Counselling.</strong> There's
      a story behind why I did this, but I'm also interested in the relationship between theology
      and psychology!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>I'm a father of two, and a husband of one!</strong> Nothing has changed my life
      quite as radically as getting married and having children. It's not every day that you
      commit to someone for life, or embark on a series of projects that take at least eighteen
      years each before they're ready to fly the nest ðŸ™‚
    </li>
  </ul>
