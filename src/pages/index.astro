    <p>Hi, I'm Rohan, and this is my first personal website and&nbsp;blog!</p>
    <p>
        I'm hoping to share some of my thoughts here &ndash; some old and some
        new. However, as I'm not a big reader myself (and I sometimes feel
        overwhelmed by how much content there is out there), I'm planning to
        only publish things that I think are particularly worth reading. This
        means it should be pretty easy to keep up with if you're interested in
        me or my&nbsp;thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've also been learning web development for fun since early 2022, so
        this space is an opportunity for me to play around and try some things.
        I'm hoping to add different features over time (e.g. an RSS feed so you
        can subscribe to updates if you're so&nbsp;inclined).
    </p>
    <p>
        It's currently under construction, so please bear with the various
        unfinished&nbsp;bits.
    </p>
