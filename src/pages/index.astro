    <p>Hi, I'm Rohan, and this is my first personal website and&nbsp;blog!</p>
    <p>
        I'm hoping to share some of my thoughts here &ndash; some old and some
        new. However, as I'm not a big reader myself (and I sometimes feel
        overwhelmed by how much content is out there), I'm planning to only
        publish things that I think are worth reading. This means it should be
        pretty easy to keep up with if you're interested in me or
        my&nbsp;thoughts :).
    </p>
    <p>
        I've also been learning web development for fun since early 2022, so
        this space is an opportunity for me to play around and try
        some&nbsp;things. I'm hoping to add different features over time (e.g.
        an RSS feed so you can subscribe to updates if you're so inclined).
    </p>
    <p>I hope you enjoy my website! :)</p>
