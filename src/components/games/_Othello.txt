I'm finding it difficult, and wondering if I need to rethink the architecture.
I'm thinking I want a function that checks a square to see if there's a valid move, 
and I want it to do it in clear steps to make it easy to debug.
I'm wanting the function to only enact the resulting move under certain conditions (probably when a certain parameter is provided)
That way, for checking if there are any valid moves, I could just iterate over the board using this function.
For the actual move, I can pass in the parameter that says it's an actual move.

WHAT ARE THE STEPS THEN?
1. Is the square already taken?
2. Are any pieces adjacent to this square?
3. If yes, are any of the pieces the opposite colour to the turn?
4. If yes, do any of the lines from these pieces include a piece of the same colour as the turn?
